# To-CG-File
A repository containing the To-CG-File script w/ associated dependencies for Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD).

The "Coarse-Grained Modeling of Coronavirus Spike Proteins and ACE2 Receptors" folder contains the version of this software associated with the Frontiers in Physics article (currently under submission review) of the same name.

Updated production models with associated changelogs will be posted here from time-to-time.

Note: The CG Tools memory leak patch featured within this script package (when used standalone) will no longer be necessary for (upcoming) 1.9.4+ versions of VMD. An official patch by VMD developers is currently under development.
